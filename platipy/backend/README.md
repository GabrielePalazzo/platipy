# PlatiPy Deployment Service Framework

This framework allows easy deployment of a image analysis tool (such as an auto-segmentation tool)
using a client-server architecture. This lets you run the tool on a server (where you have
sufficient computing resources) and send data to it from a client (which might be a script running
on a desktop PC or a client tool implemented as a plug-in or extension to a commerical system).

> Caution: This framework is designed for use in a Local Area Network (LAN) only. It is not
recommended to use this tool on the WWW without further security considerations being made.
